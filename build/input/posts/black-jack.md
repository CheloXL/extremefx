### How to play:

The objective is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The dealer has to take a card if he has 17 or more.

An ace counts as 1 or 11. face cards are worth 10. You can double down on your hand if you have the cash.

You will be dealt one card and if you win you will double your payout&hellip; of course your bet is doubled too.

You can take insurance if the dealer is showing an ace and you have enought cash. the insurance bet is 1/2 your original bet.
