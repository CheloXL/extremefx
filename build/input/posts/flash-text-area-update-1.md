Lead: First round of bugfixes to Flash TextArea
---
Thank to all who reported bugs in FlashTA. I updated the SVN and also the online zip.

## Bugfixes:

* If you placed an image at the very beggining of the text, sometimes the editor freezes.
* Problems with screen resize and text not showing, reverted back to use a scrollbar in the textarea.
* Fixed a lot of problems if the image file was invalid/corrupted/not available.
* A lot more that i don't remember right now :).
