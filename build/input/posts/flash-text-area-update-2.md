I updated FlashTA, fixing some nasty bugs regarding image duplication (note to Adobe: please, please FIX the flash html area once and for all!).

Also, i added the ability to delete a file. To delete a file, you must first select it, and then click on the "delete" icon at the left. A confirmation dialog will popup and if you click on Ok, the file will be deleted on the server.
