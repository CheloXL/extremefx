### How to play:

You have to exit from every room by hiding all the platforms. Only when you have hidden all the platforms you can advance to the next level. To make things more difficult, you must complete a level before a timer ends.

Pazzo can jump in eight directions (up, down, left, right and up-left, up-right, down-left &amp; down-right) and his jump can be short or long. Use them wisely to advance from level to level.

**Cursor keys:** standard jump.
**Shift+cursor:** long jump.
