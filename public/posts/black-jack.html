<h2 id="how-to-play">How to play:</h2>
<p>The objective is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The dealer has to take a card if he has 17 or more.</p>
<p>An ace counts as 1 or 11. face cards are worth 10. You can double down on your hand if you have the cash.</p>
<p>You will be dealt one card and if you win you will double your payout… of course your bet is doubled too.</p>
<p>You can take insurance if the dealer is showing an ace and you have enought cash. the insurance bet is 1/2 your original bet.</p>
