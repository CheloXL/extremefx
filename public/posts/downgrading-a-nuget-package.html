<p>Today I had a problem where I had blindly upgraded EF to version 6 across an entire solution, only to find out that the version was incompatible with the current MySql provider.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, instead of trying to revert back the changes from the repository/merge with the other work already in progress to fix the problems,
I decided to roll back EF to the previous version. So, I started to mess out with the nuget package manager console.</p>
<p>First I needed to get a list of projects that have a reference to the nuget package:</p>
<pre><code>$projects = Get-Project -All | Select &#64;{ Name=&quot;ProjectName&quot;;Expression={$_.ProjectName}}, &#64;{Name=&quot;Has&quot;;Expression={Get-Package EntityFramework -Project $_.Name}}
</code></pre>
<p>Then, I uninstalled the package:</p>
<pre><code>projects | select { Uninstall-Package EntityFramework -ProjectName $_.ProjectName -Force }
</code></pre>
<p>It's worth noting the use of the <em>Force</em> switch here. That can be quite dangerous as it can break other packages
(see <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/package-manager-console-powershell-reference#Uninstall-Package">NuGet Docs</a>)</p></p>
<p><em>Finally, installed the new one:</em></p>
<pre><code>$projects | select { Install-Package EntityFramework -Version 5.0.0 -ProjectName $_.ProjectName }
</code></pre>
<p><em>And that's it. That solved my problem and now I can continue working where I left...</em></p>
