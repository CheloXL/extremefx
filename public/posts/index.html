        </a>
        <p>Today I had a problem where I had blindly upgraded EF to version 6 across an entire solution, only to find out that the version was incompatible with the current MySql provider.</p>

            <h2>Creating a Culturally Customized Website</h2>
        </a>
        <p>“Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research shows that successful interaction depends on more than just using the correct language. Interaction is also dependent upon the culturally embedded meaning of objects such as icons, and metaphors such as the desktop, or the shopping cart (Bourges-Waldegg &amp; Scrivener, 1998; French &amp; Smith, 2000)”.</p>

            <h2>Website Internationalization and Accessibility</h2>
        </a>
        <p>The World Wide Web is capable of living up to its name: by being accessible to everyone in the world. This is more or less true, as there are still many web users whose needs aren’t adequately met. The Word Wide Web Consortium (<a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>) has several recommendations on how to make a webpage accessible by users, not only with disabilities, but also by users that do not speak English.</p>

        </a>
        <p>Setting up correct Locales, adding Lang attributes and localizing hard-coded images are among the technical steps detailed in this final blog in our 3-part series on <em>Website Localization with Ektron CMS</em>. We covered an overview of CMS strategy issues in part 1, and gave more technical detail and steps in Part 2. In this final blog of the series we will show you how to solve some of the issues touched on in Part 2.</p>

        <p>This is the Part 2 on <em>Website Localization using Ektron Web CMS</em>. In this part I will discuss how to correctly setup a multilingual website within Ektron and also provide some additional information about website localization in general.</p>

            <h2>Website Localization with Ektron &#x2013; Part 1</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Today many websites are powered by Web content management systems (CMS) and many enterprises author, store, and publish web content from a central CMS. We have found that <a href="http://www.ektron.com/">Ektron CMS 400.net </a> is a good choice for companies that plan on launching multilingual websites.</p>

            <h2>Website Translation, Website Localization and Website Internationalization</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Many people new to translation are confused by the terms <em>website translation</em>, <em>website internationalization</em> and <em>website localization</em>. Although each term describes a distinct process for multilingual website projects, <em>translation</em> and <em>localization</em> are often used almost interchangeably. This blog clears up the mystery around these basic concepts.</p>

            <h2>12 Steps to Website Globalization</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Whether you are trying to launch a multilingual website to expand your products and services into new global markets or increase your company's global operational efficiencies by developing multilingual extranets and intranets, website globalization is a requirement to make either a reality. You must translate (globalize) your website to empower your web presence to effectively communicate, conduct and complete international ecommerce.</p>

            <h2>Preconditionals and postconditionals checks</h2>
        </a>
        <p>How many times you found yourself writing preconditions before executing some code (like argument validation) and post-conditions (validating some result before returning the value/using on another function)?</p>

            <h2>Method overloading in flash</h2>
        </a>
        <p>As you may already know, it is not possible to have the same method with different signatures in flash (also known as method overloading).</p>

        <a href="/posts/flash-internationalization-library">
            <h2>Flash internationalization library</h2>
        </a>
        <p>This library will help you to internationalize your flash application. It supports localization of numbers, date/time, percentages and strings. It can also parse back numbers and date/time formats on a specific locale into flash internal formats.</p>

        <a href="/posts/flashxed">
            <h2>Flashxed</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Flashxed is a puzzle game in which your goal is to move similar blocks together, which causes them to disappear. Once all the blocks are gone, you've solved the level and you're presented with a new level to solve. You move blocks by pressing the mouse on them and dragging to either the right or left. If an empty space is encountered, <em>gravity</em> takes over and the blocks fall towards the bottom.</p>

        <a href="/posts/pazzo-francesco">
            <h2>Pazzo Francesco</h2>
        </a>
        <p>You have to exit from every room by hiding all the platforms. Only when you have hidden all the platforms you can advance to the next level. To make things more difficult, you must complete a level before a timer ends.</p>

        <p>As you all may know (or may not), if you want to use External Interface on a flash object that lives inside an "HTML" form, it will not work.</p>

        <a href="/posts/flash-text-area-update-3">
            <h2>Flash TextArea - Update 3</h2>
        </a>
        <p>This version should be considered <strong>BETA</strong>. It is stable enough for me, but it will surely break existing applications that depends on it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/posts/flash-text-area-update-2">
            <h2>Flash TextArea - Update 2</h2>
