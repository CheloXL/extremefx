            <h2>Flashxed</h2>
            <p>Flashxed is a puzzle game in which your goal is to move similar blocks together, which causes them to disappear. Once all the blocks are gone, you've solved the level and you're presented with a new level to solve. You move blocks by pressing the mouse on them and dragging to either the right or left. If an empty space is encountered, <em>gravity</em> takes over and the blocks fall towards the bottom.</p>

            <h2>Pazzo Francesco</h2>
            <p>You have to exit from every room by hiding all the platforms. Only when you have hidden all the platforms you can advance to the next level. To make things more difficult, you must complete a level before a timer ends.</p>

            <p>The objective is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The dealer has to take a card if he has 17 or more.</p>
