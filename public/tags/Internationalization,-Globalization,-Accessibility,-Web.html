            <h2>Website Internationalization and Accessibility</h2>
            <p>The World Wide Web is capable of living up to its name: by being accessible to everyone in the world. This is more or less true, as there are still many web users whose needs aren’t adequately met. The Word Wide Web Consortium (<a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>) has several recommendations on how to make a webpage accessible by users, not only with disabilities, but also by users that do not speak English.</p>
