            <h2>Website Localization with Ektron &#x2013; Part 1</h2>
            <p>Today many websites are powered by Web content management systems (CMS) and many enterprises author, store, and publish web content from a central CMS. We have found that <a href="http://www.ektron.com/">Ektron CMS 400.net </a> is a good choice for companies that plan on launching multilingual websites.</p>
